## **1** Magento Architecture and Customization Techniques

[Back to Index](./) | [Next Section](./2.md)

------


## **1.1** Describe Magento's module-based architecture

<kbd></kbd> **Describe module limitations.** 


**Q.** How do different modules interact with each other? 



**Q.** What side-effects can come from this interaction?








## **1.2** Describe Magento's directory structure

**Determine how to locate different types of files in Magento.** 

**Q.** Where are the files containing JavaScript, HTML, and PHP located? 

**Q.** How do you find the files responsible for certain functionality?

## **1.3** Utilize configuration XML and variables scope

**Determine how to use configuration files in Magento.** Which configuration files correspond to different features and functionality?

## **1.4** Demonstrate how to use dependency injection

**Describe Magento's dependency injection approach and architecture.** How are objects realized in Magento? Why is it important to have a centralized process creating object instances?

**Identify how to use DI configuration files for customizing Magento.** How can you override a native class, inject your class into another object, and use other techniques available in `di.xml` (such as `virtualTypes`)?

## **1.5** Demonstrate ability to use plugins

**Demonstrate how to design complex solutions using the plugin's life cycle.** 

**Q.** How do multiple plugins interact, and how can their execution order be controlled?

> Magento calls these interceptors sequentially according to a configured sort order, so they do not conflict with one another.
  

**Q.** How do you debug a plugin if it doesn't work?

**Identify strengths and weaknesses of plugins.** 



**Q.** What are the limitations of using plugins for customization? 

> **[Limitations](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/plugins.html#limitations)**
>
> * **Plugins can not be used on following:**
>   * Final methods
>   * Final classes
>   * Non-public methods
>   * Class methods (such as static methods)
>   * `__construct`
>   * Virtual types
>   * Objects that are instantiated before `Magento\Framework\Interception` is bootstrapped

**Q.** In which cases should plugins be avoided?

> **[Using Around Plugins]**(http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/ext-best-practices/extension-coding/common-programming-bp.html#using-around-plugins)
>
> **Avoid using around method plugins when they are not required because they increase stack traces and affect performance.**
>
> **The only use case for around method plugins** is when the execution of all further plugins and original methods need termination.
>
> Use **after method plugins** if you require arguments for replacing or altering function results.

## **1.6** Configure event observers and scheduled jobs

**Demonstrate how to configure observers.** How do you make your observer only be active on the frontend or backend?

**Demonstrate how to configure a scheduled job.** Which parameters are used in configuration, and how can configuration interact with server configuration?

**Identify the function and proper use of automatically available events,** for example `*_load_after`, etc.

## **1.7** Utilize the CLI

**Describe the usage of `bin/magento` commands in the development cycle.**  Which commands are available? How are commands used in the development cycle?

**Demonstrate an ability to create a deployment process.** How does the application behave in different deployment modes, and how do these behaviors impact the deployment approach for PHP code, frontend assets, etc.?

## **1.8** Demonstrate the ability to manage the cache

**Describe cache types and the tools used to manage caches.** How do you add dynamic content to pages served from the full page cache?

**Describe how to operate with cache clearing.** How would you clean the cache? In which case would you refresh cache/flash cache storage?

**Describe how to clear the cache programmatically.** What mechanisms are available for clearing all or part of the cache?
